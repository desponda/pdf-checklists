# PDF Checklists Project - Development Status

## How to Resume Development

When you resume work tomorrow, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. This will start:
   - Backend server on port 5000
   - Frontend React app on port 3000

3. Access the application at http://localhost:3000
   
4. If port conflicts occur, make sure no other services are using port 5000 by running:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :5000
   ```
   And terminate any conflicting processes.

## Current Status (May 4, 2025)

We've successfully implemented and fixed:

1. Backend API for file parsing and PDF generation
   - Fixed issue with carriage returns in filenames
   - Enhanced PDF generation with error handling and timeout protection
   - Successfully generating and downloading PDFs

2. Frontend React Application
   - Aircraft selection component
   - PDF generation functionality
   - Basic UI components (Header, Footer, Welcome)

## Port Configuration Issues

Currently experiencing a port conflict where both the Node.js server and React development server try to use port 5000:

```
[0] Server running on port 5000
[1] Something is already running on port 5000.
[1] npm run client exited with code 0
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Port Configuration**
   - Update the React development server to use a different port (3000 instead of 5000)
   - Ensure proper proxy configuration in package.json

2. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Add loading indicators during PDF generation
   - Implement progress tracking for PDF generation
   - Add better error notifications
   - Add help section explaining how to use the application

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Enhance AircraftSelector with better visual grouping
   - Add search/filter functionality for aircraft selection
   - Improve overall responsive design

4. **Functionality Enhancements**
   - Add option to select specific checklist pages
   - Remember user's last selection
   - Add thumbnail previews before generating PDF

5. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive testing of PDF generation with different aircraft models
   - Error recovery testing
   - Browser compatibility testing

## Implementation Notes

The PDF generation process has been improved with:
- Timeout configuration to prevent hanging on image fetch
- Proper error handling for each image
- Warning page when some images fail to load
- Document metadata information

The application currently has a good structure with separate components and services, making it maintainable and extendable.
